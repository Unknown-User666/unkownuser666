- 👋 Hi, I’m Brycen Long
- 👀 I’m interested in Cyber Security, Coding, and hacking.
🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQLite, Bash, Nmap, Wireshark, and Linux. I've recently taken a break from Python and Luau.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on applications and maybe some ethical hacking tools eventually. I am still within my first year of coding so it may take a while to get to that point.
